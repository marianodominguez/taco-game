# Taco Game

WIP

Free port of TACOBOT by Steve Toner 

written in cc65 for Atari 8 bit computers.

- Hopefully I'll add compatibility with other systems

A lot of
TODOs:

- Check with original game for specs, timing width.
- Add Sprites for Rat
- Use Fujinet for high scores (set rpi as server)
- Use antic mode and custom fonts
- Add splash page
- Scores (duh)
